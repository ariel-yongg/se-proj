The main.py script connects to Spotifyâ€™s API using the spotipy library to gather information about songs. It first authenticates with Spotify, allowing it to access details about tracks, such as mood, energy, and danceability.

Once it retrieves this information, the script uses it to filter or select songs based on specific criteria, like mood or energy level. This could be used to create a music player that recommends songs based on how a listener feels, or it could analyze playlists for certain features. Essentially, this script helps to find and play music that matches a specific mood or vibe.

How to run:

Make sure you first install spotipy using the command 'pip install spotipy'

Run the program by using the command ' python main.py '
